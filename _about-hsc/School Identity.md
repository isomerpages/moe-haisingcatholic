<h1>SCHOOL IDENTITY</h1>
<p><strong>About HSC</strong>
</p>
<p>Hai Sing Catholic School was founded in 1959 by the Franciscan Missionaries
of Mary (FMM) Sisters as Hai Sing Girls' High School. Back then, many of
the families living in the Serangoon and Punggol areas were very poor and
the daughters of farmers could neither read nor write. The girls did not
have the opportunity to go to school as they had to spend time taking care
of their farms and live stocks. Following the teaching of Jesus to care
for the less fortunate families, Sister Magdalena Chenti (Theresa Tsang)
and Sister Margaret Hiang started two classes of Chinese Secondary level
in classrooms provided by Holy Innocents’ Chinese Girls School in Serangoon.</p>
<p>What started as two classes gradually grew into one school as the school
thrived and achieved its mission. In 1990, Hai Sing Girls’ High School
moved to Pasir Ris, which heralded two other significant changes in the
school. The school became co-educational and its name shortened to ‘Hai
Sing High School’. At the same time, the school became multiracial, accepting
students from other races too. The last batch comprising only girls completed
their secondary education at the new school in Pasir Ris in 1992.</p>
<p>In 1999, the school changed its name to Hai Sing Catholic School to emphasise
its Catholic values. Consequently, the school’s emblem was modified as
well.</p>
<p>Over the years, Hai Sing Catholic School has modernised, embracing the
technologies of the present, introducing STEM to the programme, and computers
into the classrooms. The school’s mission has grown: not only to lead through
service, but to teach students to do the same, and to find joy in learning
and their purpose in life.</p>

<p>Ad Veritatem Per Caritatem</p>
<p>To Truth Through Charity</p>
<h2>School Song</h2>
<p>灿烂海星&nbsp;皎洁无双</p>
<p>雄视狮城&nbsp;照彻新邦</p>
<p>五育施教&nbsp;示我康庄</p>
<p>泽及南洋&nbsp;化被四方</p>
<p>坚贞名节&nbsp;真理宣扬</p>
<p>英才蔚起&nbsp;国运日昌</p>
<p>Come on Hai Sing, let us go,</p>
<p>Upward, onward, never looking back</p>
<p>Striving always with resilience</p>
<p>Excellence in all that we do</p>
<p>Let our motto be Truth &amp; Charity</p>
<p>Hai Sing shine forth</p>
<p>For all to see</p>
<h2>School Hymn</h2>
<p>Make me a channel of your peace</p>
<p>Where there is hatred let me bring your love</p>
<p>Where there is injury your pardon Lord</p>
<p>And where there's doubt true faith in you</p>
<p>Make me a channel of your peace</p>
<p>Where there's despair in life let me bring hope</p>
<p>Where there is darkness only light</p>
<p>And where there's sadness ever joy</p>
<p>Oh Master grant that I may never seek</p>
<p>So much to be consoled as to console</p>
<p>To be understood as to understand</p>
<p>To be loved as to love with all my soul</p>
<p>Make me a channel of your peace</p>
<p>It is in pardoning that we are pardoned</p>
<p>In giving of ourselves that we receive</p>
<p>And in dying that we're born to eternal life</p>
<h2>Mascot</h2>
<p>The mascot combines two aspirations that we have for Haisians: SHINEE</p>

<p>First, we hope HAIsians become captains of their own journey,&nbsp;by
taking control of the decisions they make as they navigate the seas of
learning and life.</p>
<p>Through this, we hope that students discover their ‘ME-ssion’ – their
personal mission in life&nbsp;– such that it becomes as clear as a gem.</p>
<p>As HAIsians uncover their unique strengths, we hope they also find a ‘WE-sion’,
that is&nbsp;a vision for how they can shine forth and help the people
around them.</p>
