SCHOOL IDENTITY
===============
**About HSC**

Hai Sing Catholic School was founded in 1959 by the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary (FMM) Sisters as Hai Sing Girls' High School. Back then, many of the families living in the Serangoon and Punggol areas were very poor and the daughters of farmers could neither read nor write. The girls did not have the opportunity to go to school as they had to spend time taking care of their farms and live stocks. Following the teaching of Jesus to care for the less fortunate families, Sister Magdalena Chenti (Theresa Tsang) and Sister Margaret Hiang started two classes of Chinese Secondary level in classrooms provided by Holy Innocents’ Chinese Girls School in Serangoon.   

What started as two classes gradually grew into one school as the school thrived and achieved its mission. In 1990, Hai Sing Girls’ High School moved to Pasir Ris, which heralded two other significant changes in the school. The school became co-educational and its name shortened to ‘Hai Sing High School’. At the same time, the school became multiracial, accepting students from other races too. The last batch comprising only girls completed their secondary education at the new school in Pasir Ris in 1992. 

In 1999, the school changed its name to Hai Sing Catholic School to emphasise its Catholic values. Consequently, the school’s emblem was modified as well.

Over the years, Hai Sing Catholic School has modernised, embracing the technologies of the present, introducing STEM to the programme, and computers into the classrooms. The school’s mission has grown: not only to lead through service, but to teach students to do the same, and to find joy in learning and their purpose in life.

School Song
-----------

灿烂海星 皎洁无双  

雄视狮城 照彻新邦

五育施教 示我康庄

泽及南洋 化被四方

坚贞名节 真理宣扬

英才蔚起 国运日昌

Come on Hai Sing, let us go,

Upward, onward, never looking back

Striving always with resilience

Excellence in all that we do

Let our motto be Truth & Charity

Hai Sing shine forth

For all to see

School Hymn
-----------

Make me a channel of your peace  

Where there is hatred let me bring your love

Where there is injury your pardon Lord

And where there's doubt true faith in you

Make me a channel of your peace

Where there's despair in life let me bring hope

Where there is darkness only light

And where there's sadness ever joy

Oh Master grant that I may never seek

So much to be consoled as to console

To be understood as to understand

To be loved as to love with all my soul

Make me a channel of your peace

It is in pardoning that we are pardoned

In giving of ourselves that we receive

And in dying that we're born to eternal life

Mascot
------

The mascot combines two aspirations that we have for Haisians:  SHINEE

First, we hope HAIsians become captains of their own journey, by taking control of the decisions they make as they navigate the seas of learning and life. 

Through this, we hope that students discover their ‘ME-ssion’ – their personal mission in life – such that it becomes as clear as a gem. 

As HAIsians uncover their unique strengths, we hope they also find a ‘WE-sion’, that is a vision for how they can shine forth and help the people around them.
