Hai Sing Catholic School provides multiple electronic avenues for parents to contact staff. When appropriately used, these avenues can make contact with us effective and efficient.  
  
Avenues of Contact with Staff  
  
a. Generic School Email Address – HSHS@moe.edu.sg – All teachers can be reached at this email address. This email address is checked regularly on a daily basis and the administrator channels the emails to the relevant teachers and school personnel.  
  
b. Staff Email Addresses – All teachers and staff have an email address provided to them for the purposes of work. These official email addresses end either with @moe.edu.sg or @schools.gov.sg. Teachers can also be reached directly at these email addresses.  
  
c. School Mainline – 6582 7864 – All teachers can be reached at this phone number. The operator will take a message for the teacher to return a call should they be away from their desks for teaching or other student related duties. External vendors should call the mainline and leave a message.
