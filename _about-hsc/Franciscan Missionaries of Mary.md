FRANCISCAN MISSIONARIES OF MARY
===============================

The Franciscan Missionaries of Mary (FMM) is a Catholic order comprising women of various social backgrounds and nationalities. Their work seeks to bring peace, joy and hope all over the world by helping the poor, the sick, the aged and the despised to discover God.

  

The missionary first arrived in Singapore in 1953. Through their work with the farmers of Upper Serangoon, the missionary noticed their daughters were in need of education. This led to the founding of ‘Hai Sing Girls' High School’, which has since evolved into Hai Sing Catholic School.

  

Today, the FMM continues to inspire the school. Hai Sing Catholic School endeavours to bring peace, joy and hope to others and walk the ways of God (Truth) through living for others (Charity). This is captured in our motto: Ad Veritatem per Caritatem – To Truth Through Charity.

  

Additionally, our school chaplain oversees the Catholic programmes in the school, which include mass for the Catholic students and an annual Mission Seminar for all the staff.
