FRANCISCAN MISSIONARIES OF MARY
===============================

The Franciscan Missionaries of Mary (FMM) is a Catholic order comprising women of various social backgrounds and nationalities. Their work seeks to bring peace, joy and hope all over the world by helping the poor, the sick, the aged and the despised to discover God.

  

The missionary first arrived in Singapore in 1953. Through their work with the farmers of Upper Serangoon, the missionary noticed their daughters were in need of education. This led to the founding of ‘Hai Sing Girls' High School’, which has since evolved into Hai Sing Catholic School.

  

Today, the FMM continues to inspire the school. Hai Sing Catholic School endeavours to bring peace, joy and hope to others and walk the ways of God (Truth) through living for others (Charity). This is captured in our motto: Ad Veritatem per Caritatem – To Truth Through Charity.

  

Additionally, our school chaplain oversees the Catholic programmes in the school, which include mass for the Catholic students and an annual Mission Seminar for all the staff.![](/images/sister.png)

Hai Sing is a Franciscan Missionaries of Mary (FMM) School because it was founded by the FMM Sisters.

  

The Franciscan Missionaries of Mary come from all races and social classes from 67 different nationalities. They work in solidarity with everyone, regardless of race or religion and strive for a more humane and peaceful world.

  

They help the poor, sick, aged and despised, helping people to discover God. They bring peace, joy and hope, always living for others.

  

We at Hai Sing endeavor to be like them and bring peace, joy and hope to others and walk the ways of God (Truth) through living for others (Charity). Thus, our school's motto: Truth & Charity.
