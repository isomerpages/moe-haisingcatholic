<h1>School Leaders' Message</h1>
<p><strong>A warm and heartfelt welcome to Hai Sing Catholic School.</strong>
</p>
<p>At Hai Sing Catholic School, our mission is to nurture students for a
future that extends beyond mere academic success. We place an unwavering
focus on developing our students to be purposeful individuals, lifelong
learners, and caring leaders. We believe in providing an environment where
students can flourish, guided by the values of Truth and Charity. HSC is
not just a school; it is a Home where hearts belong, a School where students
shine forth, and a Community that leads, cares, and serves.</p>
<p>One of our core beliefs is to instill a passion for learning and to equip
our students with the values and dispositions they need to take charge
of their own education. We promote student agency because we understand
that it is through this self-driven approach that students truly excel
and become lifelong learners.</p>
<p>Hai Sing Catholic School was founded by the Franciscan Missionaries of
Mary (FMM). We are proud of our rich history and our ties to the many FMM
schools around the world.&nbsp; We draw upon our Catholic and Franciscan
heritage to anchor our students of all faiths on values that they may live
their lives purposefully in service to their community and the world.</p>
<p>We are excited to partner you on this transformative journey of education
and personal growth.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ad Veritatem Per Caritatem and Hai Sing shine forth!</em></strong>
