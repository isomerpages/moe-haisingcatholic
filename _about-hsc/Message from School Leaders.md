# **School Leaders' Message**


**A warm and heartfelt welcome to Hai Sing Catholic School!**

At Hai Sing Catholic School, our mission is to nurture students for a future that extends beyond mere academic success. We place an unwavering focus on developing our students to be purposeful individuals, lifelong learners, and caring leaders. We believe in providing an environment where students can flourish, guided by the values of Truth and Charity. HSC is not just a school; it is a Home where hearts belong, a School where students shine forth, and a Community that leads, cares, and serves.

One of our core beliefs is to instill a passion for learning and to equip our students with the tools they need to take charge of their own education. We promote student agency because we understand that it is through this self-driven approach that students truly excel and become lifelong learners.

Hai Sing Catholic School was founded by the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary (FMM). We are proud of our rich history and our ties to the many FMM schools around the world.  We draw upon our Catholic and Franciscan heritage to anchor our students of all faiths on values that they may live their lives purposefully in service to their community and the world.  

As one of the many international schools around the world, we draw upon our Catholic heritage to anchor our students in positive values and beliefs that build their character.

We are excited to partner you on this transformative journey of education and personal growth.

***Ad Veritatem Per Caritatem and Hai Sing shine forth!***
