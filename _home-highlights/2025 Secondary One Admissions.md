</p>
<p>2. <strong>Writing materials</strong>
</p>
<p>3. <strong>Water bottle</strong>
</p>
<p>4. <strong>Money (sufficient for recess and lunch)</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Estimated cost of a meal in the canteen would range between $2.50-$5 per
meal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modes of payment- Cash (students would not have their phones with them
hence Paynow would not be encouraged even if the stalls accept it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>• Please do not send your child to school if s/he is unwell and/ or is
given a medical certificate.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT</u></strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There will be<strong> NO lessons</strong> on the first two days of school
as the orientation program is going on therefore students<strong> do not</strong> have
to bring their textbooks on 2 and 3 January 2025.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formal lessons will begin on Monday, 6Jan 2025. Students are encouraged
to pack their books according to their timetable once they receive it.
In HSC, we strive to develop independence in our students hence, parents
can encourage their child to check with their teachers personally if they
are unsure of the books to bring for the day.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Morning assembly starts punctually at 7:30am daily</strong>.
Hence, students should be seated at the assembly venue earlier.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We believe that being punctual and having proper attire and grooming is
an outward expression of their readiness to learn and grow. Parents/Guardians
are encouraged to support their child/ward to be responsible for their
own grooming and punctuality.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mobile phone policy&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Please note that as part of our school’s efforts to promote overall student
wellbeing, the school has a strict mobile phone usage policy to regulate
screen time while in school. This policy is implemented with the intention
of fostering a conducive learning environment that encourages students
to interact with one another face to face, and promoting meaningful connections
and effective communication within the school community.
<br>
<br><strong>Students are not allowed to use their handphones within curriculum hours</strong>.
Students will have to adhere to the handphone routines set by the school
to keep their phones. Should your child/ward need to bring their handphone,
they would need to adhere to the following conditions:
<br>
<br>- Handphones will be kept out of sight, in the classroom cupboard and
switched off from the start of school till dismissal. This includes the
changeover of lessons and recess time.
<br>- Students can only use their handphones for learning purposes under the
instructions and supervision of their teachers.
<br>- Should you wish to contact your child/ward, please call the school’s
General Office at 6582 7864. We will share more information with your child/ward
during the orientation to help your child/ward better understand the rules
and expectations.
<br>

<p>Through the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP), all secondary
school students will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD).
Secondary one students would be invited to purchase a school-prescribed
PLD. Students who are Singapore Citizens can use their Edusave Account
to pay for the PLD.
<br>
<br>The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform –

also enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as
they navigate an increasingly digitised world.
