Hai Experiential Week was another resounding success this year! Interesting workshops were curated for different levels and streams of students to ensure an engaging student experience. Skills such as team building and cultivating an adventurous spirit were honed through our PAdDLe workshop. HAIsians designed and painted their very own Mandala art, did rattan weaving and Batik painting to unleash their creativity, and went on various learning journeys to explore their cultural heritage. Not forgetting to cater to the outdoor learning experience of our HAIsians, our Secondary 2 students went on a 3-day non-residential Adventure Camp!
