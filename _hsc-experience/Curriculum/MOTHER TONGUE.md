<h2>Student Voice</h2>
<p><em>‘Malay lessons have helped me to appreciate the Malay language and culture better. The lessons are always filled with quizzes and meaningful stories from the teacher’s experience. These activities are engaging and make me understand the language better. The quizzes help me understand better as my teachers always explain the answers afterwards.’</em>&nbsp;–
Putera Azfar B Azahari, 3 Adaptability&nbsp;_‘</p>
<p>After Covid-19 measures were eased, our Malay language teachers gave us
the opportunity to go for a learning journey to Kampong Glam. We visited
many places including the Malay Heritage Centre, and even made traditional
kueh. The learning journey has sparked my interest in finding out more
about the Malay culture.’_&nbsp;– Nazzyfa Nazzura Bte Mohd Naser, 3 Independence.</p>

<h3><strong>Foreign Languages In Lieu of Mother Tongue Language (French, German, Japanese, Arabic, Burmese, Thai)</strong></h3>
<p>For the learning of Foreign Languages and Asian Languages in lieu of an
official MTL, you will need to make private study arrangements for your
child and ensure that your private education provider can prepare your
child for the GCE O-Level examinations at the end of secondary school.
There will be MTL requirements for progression to the next level of study.
