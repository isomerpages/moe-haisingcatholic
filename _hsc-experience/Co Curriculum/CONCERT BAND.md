Student Voice
-------------

_‘I enjoy being in the band because there are endless opportunities to learn from one another. On top of this, I find great joy and satisfaction when producing music with my fellow band members. Band helps us bond together as One Hai Sing! One thing I learnt in band is that, no matter how hard it gets, we never give up!’_
