Student Voice

_‘One of the most important skills for a choir to run smoothly is teamwork. We have to learn how to work together for us to perform the pieces well. Though there were many challenges faced as we practised for performances, we managed to overcome them by working together as a team and listening to each other for feedback on how we can better improve ourselves for future performances. On a personal level, being in choir not only taught me values such as discipline, teamwork, and respect, but also gave me many opportunities to develop my leadership skills and build my self- confidence.’_
