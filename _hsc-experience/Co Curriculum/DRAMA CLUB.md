Student Voice
-------------

_‘Be loud. Be proud. Be you. That’s the motto of the drama club. The motto has urged me to be myself and never change myself to ‘fit in’. Being in the drama club has made me realise that we have many hidden talents and we get to learn the talent we have deep within us. Drama Club has taught me to appreciate myself through my performances. I often find myself calling the drama club, a drama family and I am proud to be in our drama family.’_
