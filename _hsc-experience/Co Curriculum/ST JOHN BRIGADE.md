Student Voice
-------------

_‘I have learnt that working together as a team is crucial in SJB. A team is as strong as the weakest link. So a lack of cooperation and communication can potentially cause issues during CCA trainings and competition trainings. One of my fond memories as a SJB cadet would be training for the First Aid Competition. There were a number of challenges thrown our way, but we managed to work together as a team to overcome these obstacles. As a team, we also tried to find humour in the mistakes made during the competition trainings, instead of being frustrated.’_
