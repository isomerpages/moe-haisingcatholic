Many think that running is a purely physical activity but it is actually a lot more than that. The training sessions not only allow me to have some understanding of the challenges faced by world-class athletes but more importantly, I have learnt to focus and develop the determination to overcome obstacles and fatigue. I have gained a new perspective on large and small problems alike. Running builds my capacity to endure and to overcome challenges and this gives me strength in other areas of my life. I will cherish the precious memories and friendships forged for a long, long time to come. HAI Athletics Club has trained me not just for competitions, but also for the race ahead - that is life!’</em></p><p>Warren Illias Tan<br>Captain</p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="569" width="960" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQ2-4DUn4Cq94hbeGVnLi7LvQFkln5DTQt4CG4aDtXPPQN1w_gbMqBEaT0uT7r9TtO11fLy--FC0aSj/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe></div><p></p>
