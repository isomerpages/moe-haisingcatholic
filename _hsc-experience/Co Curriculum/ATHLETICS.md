Student Voice
-------------

_‘I have gained a myriad of benefits from my CCA. Many think that running is a purely physical activity but it is actually a lot more than that. The training sessions not only allow me to have some understanding of the challenges faced by world-class athletes but more importantly, I have learnt to focus and develop the determination to overcome obstacles and fatigue. I have gained a new perspective on large and small problems alike. Running builds my capacity to endure and to overcome challenges and this gives me strength in other areas of my life. I will cherish the precious memories and friendships forged for a long, long time to come. HAI Athletics Club has trained me not just for competitions, but also for the race ahead - that is life!’_
