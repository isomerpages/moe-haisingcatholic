Every member is equipped with fast problem-solving skills and is adaptable to changes through teamwork. Although we do not receive the fame and recognition, everyone knows that only the support from the shadows makes an event successful. As the time comes for the old to retire and the new to take over, we effectively pass down our skills and knowledge to the next in line to ensure the support continues.’</em></p><p>Bliss Boey<br>Senior Exco</p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="569" width="960" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vR8UOq2IxUZe0eq8Gn9PnqTMp9fc50Q5ksHh-ucbAIhHHhRjQz1bGMei77uFRQcJgdhEaQBRaH3qWLx/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe></div><p></p>
