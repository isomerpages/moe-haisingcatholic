As an athlete, I believe it's all about dedication, sacrifice, hard work, and determination to see the results you want. You must not only be competitive, but also possess ability. Regardless of the circumstances you face, never quit. I have also learnt to apply these personal traits to my academic life. I have also forged many strong bonds with my teammates and I realised that friendship is really important as at some point, we will need someone who can go through thick and thin with us. My CCA has really brought me to where I am now and it is something I treasure greatly.’</em></p><p>Hazel<br>Member</p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="569" width="960" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSsShnZo54s7ioIC7iCNF3E_kJ2S_OskiBa_2c7U-6Yxo1C3yEMCKuV-snpm5VeAbypR5s2VfhiKn-Z/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe></div><p></p>
