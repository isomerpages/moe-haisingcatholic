PARENTS (PSG)
=============

Hai Sing Parent Connect Group
-----------------------------

 Hai Sing Parent Connect Group has been established for more than 20 years and has seen a growing membership. Besides homemakers and working mothers who take time off work to participate in various events, we have seen a growing number of fathers and grandparents. Our members come together to volunteer their services in various school programmes and share parenting tips with one another. We continue to look forward to having more parents and guardians of HAIsians connect through their participation in the events the schools will host. As a member of the PCG, some of the programmes/events you will be involved in are:  

     1)    Sec 1 Camp Fire
		 
		 
     2)    Racial Harmony Day Booth  
		 
		 
     3)    Sports Carnival
		 
		 
     4)    Teachers’ Day Programme
		 
		 
     5)    Preparation of Encouragement Pack for graduating classes. (Parents come together to sponsor and pack little treats, and write positive messages on bookmarks to encourage our graduating students.)_
		 
The HSC PCG welcomes parents, guardians and even grandparents of HAIsians to join us in enhancing the students’ school experience.
