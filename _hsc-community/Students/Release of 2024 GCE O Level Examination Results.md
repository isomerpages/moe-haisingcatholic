GRADUATION CEREMONY 2023
========================

The Graduation Day ceremony for the class of 2023 was conducted at Temasek Convention Centre at Temasek Polytechnic. With a total audience of close to 1000 members comprising parents, staff and students, our Hai Sians received their Graduation Folders with poise and grace from Ms Adeline Lim, our Principal and Ms Shereen Wong, our Vice-Principal respectively. The ceremony concluded successfully and it was the perfect farewell for our Hai Sians who will start the next chapter in their journey. Our blessings will always be with them as they shine forth and spread their shining light to others around them.
