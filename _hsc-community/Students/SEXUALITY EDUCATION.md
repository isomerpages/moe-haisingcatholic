<h1>SEXUALITY EDUCATION</h1>
<p><strong>MOE SEXUALITY EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools
aims to enable students to understand the physiological, social and emotional
changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
with others, including those with members of the opposite sex, and make
wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised
on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means
encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units
with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based
on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious
communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality
Education are to:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Support students in managing their
physiological, social and emotional changes as they grow up and develop
safe and healthy relationships.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guide students to make wise, informed
and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help students develop a moral
compass and respect for themselves and others by having positive mainstream
values and attitudes about sexuality that are premised on the family as
the basic unit of society.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of
Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love and respect yourself as you
love and respect others;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build positive relationships
based on love and respect (which are the foundation for strong families);</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make responsible decisions for
yourself, your family and society; and</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstinence before marriage is
the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies. Casual
sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.</p>

<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
<p><strong><u>Sexuality Education Lessons</u></strong>:</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The values and attitudes of our
youth towards sexuality are increasingly shaped by their peers, exposure
to the media, popular culture and the internet. Adolescence is a complex
stage in life as the adolescent attempts to find his or her own identity
and often struggles with new social relationships. The period of middle
adolescence (generally from 15 – 17 years old) can be a turbulent period
for adolescents. The gap between physical and emotional/cognitive maturity
may result in a tendency to act on impulse, experiment with various activities
(including sexual activities), sometimes without understanding the unpleasant
consequences that may arise from such experimentation. The need for peer
acceptance can be overwhelmingly strong and hinder one’s ability to act
responsibly.&nbsp; Given the pressures faced by the middle adolescent from
within themselves and from peers, it is important to build a strong sense
of self-worth, personal conviction and an understanding of the possible
consequences of sexual behaviour.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the Sexuality Education
lessons, secondary students will have the opportunity to develop a positive
self-esteem, develop their character, and expand their understanding and
repertoire of skills to deal with various issues related to sexuality,
which are of prime concern at this age.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;At Hai Sing Catholic School, the following Sexuality Education lessons will be taught in <u>2026</u>:</strong>

<p><strong>eTeens&nbsp;Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>eTeens</em> is a programme that
was developed by Health Promotion Board, in collaboration with the Ministry
of Education, to provide Secondary 3 students with accurate information
on STIs, HIV and protection from a health perspective. With the formation
of the Communicable Diseases Agency (CDA) on 1 April 2025, the programme
would now be managed by CDA’s Training and Education Division instead of
HPB. <em>eTeens</em> is conducted in two segments – a mass talk segment and
a classroom-based programme. The desired outcome of the <em>eTeens</em> programme
is that students are empowered to make wise, informed and sensible decisions
to protect themselves from sexually transmitted infectious diseases.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are taught skills such
as decision-making, assertiveness and negotiation to say “no” to sex and
negative peer pressure. They also learn that the impact of STIs/HIV extends
beyond themselves and involves their family, and the importance of responsible
decision-making and seeking help. Abstinence and upholding family values
are the key messages.</p>
<p><strong>At Hai Sing Catholic School, the <em>eTeens</em> programme will be implemented as follows in 2026:</strong>
