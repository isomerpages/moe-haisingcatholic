GRADUATION CEREMONY 2022
========================

The Graduation Day ceremony for the class of 2022 was conducted at Temasek Convention Centre at Temasek Polytechnic. With a total audience of close to 1000 members comprising parents, staff and students, our Hai Sians received their Graduation Folders with poise and grace from Mr Daniel Ang and Ms Shereen Wong, our Principal and Vice - Principal respectively. The ceremony concluded successfully and it was the perfect farewell for our Hai Sians who will start the next chapter in their journey. Our blessings will always be with them as they shine forth and spread their shining light to others around them.
