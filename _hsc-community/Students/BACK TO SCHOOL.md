<h1><strong>Back To School Programme</strong></h1><p>At Hai Sing Catholic School, the<strong> Secondary One Orientation</strong> and <strong>Back-to-School Programme</strong> serve as the compass guiding our Haisians towards an enriching academic voyage.</p><p>The orientation lays the foundation for lasting connections, emphasising camaraderie and teamwork, while the Back-to-School Programme equips students with the tools to navigate the Secondary school life successfully. In this holistic approach, we aim to fulfill the <strong>ME-ssion</strong>, where "ME" represents finding one's own unique purpose and talents in the HSC journey and "<strong>WE-ssion</strong>" signifies students working together for the greater good of the community.</p><p>Through these student development experiences, students discover purpose not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering a sense of community, setting sail together as one HSC family, and embracing the collective mission of growth, support, and celebration throughout their academic journey at Hai Sing Catholic School.</p><p></p><p><strong><u>Please on the links below for the PDF timetable for the respective levels.</u></strong></p><p>Back to School for Sec 1: <a href="/files/Time Table/BTS_2024_Timetable___S1_Timetable.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Click Here</a></p><p>Back to School for Sec 2: <a href="/files/Time Table/BTS_2024_Timetable___S2_TT.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Click here</a></p><p>Back to School for Sec 3: <a href="/files/Time Table/BTS_2024_Timetable___S3_TT.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Click here</a></p><p>Back to School for Sec 4/5: <a href="/files/Time Table/sec4 sec 5 2023 sem 2 class 23062023.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Click here</a></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Sec 1 registration/Back_to_school_poster.jpeg"></div><p></p>
