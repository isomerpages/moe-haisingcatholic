FULL SUBJECT-BASED BANDING
==========================

Purpose of Full SBB
-------------------

Full SBB is part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.  
  
With Full SBB implemented in HSC, the school will be better able to meet our students’ learning needs and recognise their strengths and interests. Our students will grow their confidence and develop an intrinsic motivation to discover their purpose in life and derive joy in learning.  
  
By 2024, secondary schools will have implemented the following aspects of Full SBB: Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2; and Mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum.
