FULL SUBJECT-BASED BANDING
==========================

Purpose of Full SBB
-------------------

Full SBB is part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.  
  
With Full SBB implemented in HSC, the school will be better able to meet our students’ learning needs and recognise their strengths and interests. Our students will grow their confidence and develop an intrinsic motivation to discover their purpose in life and derive joy in learning.  
  
By 2024, secondary schools will have implemented the following aspects of Full SBB: Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2; and Mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum.

Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students may also offer these subjects at a more demanding level based on their performance in secondary school.

Mixed form classes at the lower secondary level with the provision of a common curriculum from 2023
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2023 cohort of Secondary 1 students will be grouped in mixed form classes where each form class would comprise students from different courses of study.  
  
Mixed form classes would present students with more opportunities to interact with other students taking different subject combinations, and with different strengths and interests. This common learning experience would allow students to build meaningful friendships, and appreciate different perspectives. It can also help reduce the inadvertent labelling associated with streaming.  
  
In their mixed form classes, students will take a set of subjects at a common level, amounting to about one-third of curriculum time. This would allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together in these subjects.  
  
These subjects are:  
Art  
Character and Citizenship Education  
Design and Technology  
Food and Consumer Education  
Music  
Physical Education  
  
Teachers will adopt a range of teaching approaches to meet the different learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.  
  
Students will be regrouped for English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, and Science lessons. These subjects will continue to be offered at Express Level, N(A) Level, and N(T) Level. The criteria for taking these subjects at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One is based on students’ PSLE AL Score for each subject. Students will be grouped in different classes based on their subject level for each subject.
