<h1><strong>Back To School Programme</strong></h1><p>At Hai Sing Catholic School, the<strong> Secondary One Orientation</strong> and <strong>Back-to-School Programme</strong> serve as the compass guiding our High School Champions towards an enriching academic voyage. </p><p>The orientation lays the foundation for lasting connections, emphasising camaraderie and teamwork, while the Back-to-School Programme equips students with the tools to navigate the Secondary school life successfully. In this holistic approach, we aim to fulfill the <strong>ME-ssion</strong>, where "ME" represents finding one's own unique purpose and talents in the HSC journey and "<strong>WE-ssion</strong>" signifies students working together for the greater good of the community. Through these student development experiences, students discover purpose not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering a sense of community, setting sail together as one HSC family, and embracing the collective mission of growth, support, and celebration throughout their academic journey at Hai Sing Catholic School.</p>
