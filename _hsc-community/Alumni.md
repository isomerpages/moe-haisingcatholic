ALUMNI
======

In Hai Sing, we believe that our connection with the HAIsian family continues even beyond graduation. Hence, One Haising Alumni was established as our Hai Sing alumni organization to unite all past HAIsians to continue their Hai legacy and support future generations of HAIsians. It serves as a network bridge to connect all alumni who are presently serving in our society to their alma mater. One Haising Alumni serves to connect the 3 generations of graduates (as well as teachers) from Hai Sing Girls High School (1959-1989), Hai Sing High School (1990-1999) and High Sing Catholic School (1999 to present) together. It aims to serve as a common platform to pass on our One Haising Alumni motto:

#### ‘GUIDED BY THE MOTTO OF TRUTH AND CHARITY, AS CHILDREN OF GOD, WE ARE UNITED IN UPLIFTING THE SPIRIT OF OUR TRADITIONS AS WE NURTURE FUTURE GENERATIONS TOGETHER.’

Our alumni also contributes in various ways, providing guidance and support for current students in all aspects of their HSC journey. Former students return to share tertiary education experience and provide consultations to the current students and also help out during CCA sessions where they would help to coach the current students. Some CCAs that enjoy this collaboration between past and present students are our Infocomm Club and uniformed groups (NPCC, SJB and NCC), etc.
