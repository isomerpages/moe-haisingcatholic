<p>Students are regrouped for English Language, Mother Tongue Languages,
Mathematics, and Science lessons; they will read these subjects at the&nbsp;

</p>

<p><strong><em>5. As a Catholic school, is there any difference in education experience between a Catholic and a non-Catholic student?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>At Hai Sing Catholic School, we provide a values-based education that
focuses on holistic development and growth of our students so that they
become versions of themselves, capable of contributing to a better society
and world. While we are a Catholic school, the values we impart to our
students are universal in nature such as being truthful and having compassion,
etc.</p>
<p>As a Catholic School, we start our day with a short morning prayer every
morning led by our Catholic student leaders. Non-Catholic students are
encouraged to pray in their own faith or respect the prayer by observing
silence. This morning routine helps our students to calm their mind so
that they are prepared for each new school day.</p>
<p>The school has one chaplain and a small group of Catholic teachers who
lead the Catholic Fellowship (CF) team. Monthly Masses and CF activities
are organised for Catholic students to strengthen character and form their
faith.</p>
<p><strong><em>6. My child’s PSLE score does not meet your school’s cut-off point. As a Catholic family, do we get any advantage in terms of admission?</em></strong>

<p>The Secondary 1 Posting Exercise is based on students’ PSLE score. Appeals
can only be considered if your child’s PSLE score meets the schools’ cut-off
point of the posting year, subject to available vacancies and meeting MOE’s
criteria.</p>
<h2><strong>C. Curriculum-Related Information about Hai Sing Catholic School</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>1. Does Hai Sing Catholic School implement Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB)?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Yes. The school has been implementing <strong><em>Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB) since</em></strong> 2023.
Students can offer English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics
and Science at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One,
based on students’ PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each subject.</p>
<p>Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students may also offer these subjects
at a more demanding level based on their performance in secondary school.
As part of the implementation of FSBB, the school provides Secondary 2
students with the opportunity to offer Humanities subjects at a more demanding
level, if they meet subject-specific requirements. The criteria will be
based on the following:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject-specific academic grade requirements</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students’ aptitude for and interest in
these subjects at Secondary 1</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teachers’ feedback on students attitude
and disposition towards learning and their commitment to offer the subject
at a more demanding level</p>
<p><strong><em>2. Will there still be lateral transfers available under this new system?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The provision for students to offer all their subjects at a more demanding
level, or what is currently known as "lateral transfer", will continue
to be available. Schools will guide students on their subject and subject
level options based on their individual circumstances, strengths and interests
in different subjects, overall ability to cope, and well-being.</p>
<p><strong><em>3. Under FSBB, will students still take GCE O- and N-Level examinations at the end of their secondary education?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Under FSBB, the GCE O- and N-Level examinations will be replaced with
the new Singapore Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) examinations.
This will apply from the 2024 Secondary One cohort onwards. From 2027,
the national certification will reflect the subject level at which each
subject is taken.</p>
<p><strong><em>4. What Mother Tongue Languages are offered in the school?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The school offers Chinese Language, Higher Chinese Language and Malay
Language.</p>
<p><strong><em>6. Can my child offer both O Level Mother Tongue and Higher Mother Tongue at the same time?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>No. Your child will only offer Higher Mother Tongue should he/she be deemed
eligible to take the subject. However, your child will have to sit for
the O-Levels Mother Tongue Examination when he/she is in Secondary 3.</p>
<p><strong><em>7. What are the benefits of taking Higher Mother Tongue?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Students who take Higher Mother Tongue at O-Levels and attain a grade
between A1-C6 in both English and Higher Mother Tongue will be eligible
for 2 Bonus Points for Junior College Admission. They will also have the
option to use it to replace English as L1 for Junior College Admission.</p>
<p><strong><em>8. What are the key differences between Higher Mother Tongue Syllabus and Mother Tongue Syllabus?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Higher Mother Tongue (HMT) is a more demanding subject compared to Mother
Tongue (MT) as it is considered to be an L1 subject, just like English.
The aim of HMT is to help students to achieve a higher level of language
proficiency and cultural knowledge. The subject will require students to
have a strong mastery of the language as they will be exposed to a range
of texts - local texts, literary texts, news articles etc., which require
a higher level of thinking and analytical skills. Students will be assessed
on four components at the ‘O’ levels: Oral, Composition Writing and Comprehension.</p>
<p>For MT, the key aim is for students to develop skills for them to be able
to continue learning and appreciating the language beyond their schooling
years. As such, the texts chosen are closer to the Singapore context and
the skills needed will be less demanding. The students will be assessed
on four components at ‘O’ level, Oral, Listening, Composition Writing and
Comprehension.</p>
<h2><strong><u>D. Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Matters</u></strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>1. Is it compulsory for my child to take part in CCA?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Yes. CCA participation is compulsory for all students in secondary schools.
It is an important part of school life that inculcates good character and
life skills. For a full list of our school’s CCAs, please refer to our
school website.</p>
<p><strong><em>2. How many times do students attend CCAs per week?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>CCAs are conducted twice a week. However, during the preparation for significant
events such as the National School Games (NSG) or Singapore Youth Festival
(SYF), students may be required to attend CCAs three times a week. Do look
at our school website for the schedule of all CCAs.</p>
<p><strong><em>3. What are the benefits of CCA participation?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The CCA Programme provides students with a platform to discover their
interests and talents. As a key Student Development Experience (SDE) in
school, CCA plays a pivotal role in developing students’ character and
citizenship dispositions.</p>
<p>The CCA programme offers excellent platforms for students to learn core
values, social and emotional competencies and achieve HSC’s Desired Student
Outcomes. All CCAs emphasise social interaction by providing a common space
for friendships and social integration amongst students of diverse backgrounds.
Through CCA, students develop a sense of identity and belonging to the
school.</p>
<p>At the end of the graduating year, students’ co-curricular attainment
will be recognised according to the levels of Excellent/Good/Fair. The
level of attainment will be converted to a bonus point(s) which can be
used for admission to Junior Colleges/ Polytechnics/ Institutes of Technical
Education (JC/Poly/ITE). For example, 2 Bonus Points for ‘Excellent’ and
1 Bonus Point for ‘Good’.</p>
<p></p>
<h2><strong>E. Personal Learning Devices (PLD) Matters</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>1. Do students need to bring their PLD daily or are they allowed to use school laptops?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>All students are strongly encouraged to purchase a PLD via the MOE bulk
tender through the school when they enrol in January. They are expected
to bring their PLDs to school on a daily basis once they have received
them.
<br>
<br>Note: Only devices installed with the school-approved Device Management
Application (DMA) are allowed for teaching and learning use in school.</p>
<p><strong><em>2. When do I need to purchase the PLD for my child?<br></em></strong>
<br>For Sec One students, the school will engage you on the procedure to purchase
your child’s PLD on the 1st week of school via Parents Gateway. The delivery
of PLDs is expected to be around the start of Term 2 (subjected to the
availability of stock).</p>
<p><strong><em>3. How will my child learn in class with this PLD? How can I get more information regarding the PDLP?</em></strong>
</p>
