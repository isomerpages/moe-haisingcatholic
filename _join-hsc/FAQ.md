A. General Information on School Posting
----------------------------------------

1.  **How will my child be posted under the new AL system?**

  

Under the new posting system, academic merit (PSLE Score) is still the first criterion for posting. The first student considered has the best PSLE Score and will be posted to the school that is their first choice. A student’s choice order of schools will be used as one of the tie-breakers if there are two students with the same PSLE Score vying for the last place in a school. 

  

When there are two or more students with the same PSLE Score vying for the last available place(s) in a school, will tie-breakers be applied in the following order: 

  

First, Citizenship (Singapore Citizen has the highest priority, then Permanent Resident, and lastly International Student) 

  

Second, school choice order (first choice over second choice, and so on) 

  

If citizenship status and school choice order are the same, then computerised balloting will be used to determine who to be admitted. 

  

Students will only be balloted when those vying for the last place(s) in the same school have the same PSLE Score, citizenship and choice order of schools.

  

2.  **What will happen to my child if he/she is not posted to any of the chosen schools?**  
    
      
    

You are advised to place your preferred school at a higher rank and include at least 2-3 schools where your child’s PSLE Score is better than the school’s Cut-Off-Point (COP). Also, do make use of and fill in all six school choices. This will increase your child’s chances of being posted to a school of your choice. 

  

If your child is not placed in any of their school choices, they will be posted to the nearest school with available vacancies, based on their PSLE Scores and registered home address.

  

3.  **What are the considerations for S1 posting transfer appeals and what do I need to do if I wish to put up an appeal?**
    
      
    
    MOE will consider appeals for school transfer only for exceptional cases. Such transfers will only be considered for students with serious medical conditions or severe physical impairments (for example those requiring a wheelchair).  
      
    Students who wish to appeal for transfer must still complete formalities at the posted school. Please check with the posted school for the mass appeal process.   
      
    Appeal results will only be made known to applicants in early January through the posted Secondary School. Applicants should continue to attend lessons at their posted school while waiting for the results of the appeal.  
      
    If you are seeking a transfer due to reasons other than (medical conditions, or disability) you may approach the school of choice directly. Do note that your child’s PSLE score should meet the schools’ cut-off point of the posting year. Transfers will be subjected to available vacancies and meeting the school-based criteria.

B. General Information about Hai Sing Catholic School
-----------------------------------------------------

**4\. What are the courses offered in the School?**

  

The school offers Express, NA and NT courses.

  

Our school will implement mixed form classes starting from the Secondary 1 cohort of students entering our school in 2023.

  

The 2023 cohort of Secondary 1 students will be grouped in mixed form classes where each form class would comprise students from different courses of study.

  

Mixed form classes would present students with more opportunities to interact with other students taking different subject combinations, and with different strengths and interests. This common learning experience would allow students to build meaningful friendships, and appreciate different perspectives. It can also help reduce the inadvertent labelling associated with streaming.

  

In their mixed form classes, students will take a set of subjects at a common level, amounting to about one-third of curriculum time. This would allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together in these subjects.

  

These subjects are:  
Art  
Character and Citizenship Education  
Design and Technology  
Food and Consumer Education   
Music  
Physical Education

  

Teachers will adopt a range of teaching approaches to meet the different learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.

  

Students will be regrouped for English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, and Science lessons. These subjects will continue to be offered at G3 Express Level, G2 N(A) Level, and G1 N(T) Level. The criteria for taking these subjects at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One is based on students’ PSLE AL Score for each subject. Students will be grouped in different classes based on their subject level for each subject.

  



**5\. What are the indicative PSLE score ranges of 202 PSLE students posted to 202 Sec 1?**

The following are the indicative PSLE score ranges for the different courses offered by the school:

  

Express: 10 -16

N(A): 21 - 24

N(T): 25 - 28

  



**6\. My child qualifies for the Express course, but his PSLE score does not meet your cut-off. Can we opt for the Normal Academic course in your school?**


  

If your child has met the qualifying PSLE score for the Express course, he/she has to opt for the given course. Your child can only opt for the school’s N(A) course if he/she has met the qualifying PSLE score for the Express/N(A) Option band, or the N(A) course.

  



**7\. Is the school affiliated to any Junior College?**


  

The school is affiliated to Catholic Junior College. Hence, 2 bonus points can be awarded under the Joint Admission Exercise (JAE) for eligible students who opt for Catholic Junior College as their first or second choice.

  


**8\. Where can I find detailed information on transport, subjects offered, CCAs, school outcomes and special student development programmes?**


  

Such information is made available via MOE SchoolFinder

[https://www.moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder?journey=Secondary%20school](https://www.moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder?journey=Secondary%20school)[  
](https://www.moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder?journey=Secondary%20school)

  


**9\. As a Catholic school, is there any difference in education experience between a Catholic and a non-Catholic student?**


  

At Hai Sing, we provide a values-based education that focuses on holistic development and growth of our students so that they become versions of themselves, capable of contributing to a better society and world. While we are a Catholic school, the values we impart to our students are universal in nature such as being truthful and having compassion, etc.

  

As a Catholic School, we start our day with a short morning prayer every morning led by our Catholic student leaders while the rest of the non-Catholic students would respect the prayer being said by observing silence. This helps our students to calm their mind so that they are better prepared for each new school day.

  

The school has one chaplain and a small group of Catholic teachers who lead the Catholic Fellowship (CF) team. Monthly Masses and CF activities are organised for Catholic students to strengthen character and for faith formation.

  



**10\. My child’s PSLE cut-off is below that for your school. As a Catholic family, do we get any advantage in terms of admission?**


  

The Secondary 1 Posting Exercise is based on students’ PSLE score. Appeals can only be considered if your child’s PSLE score meets the schools’ cut-off point of the posting year, subject to available vacancies and meeting MOE’s criteria.

Students will sit for the GCE N-Level examination in 2026 and those who are eligible for and wish to take up the 5th year in 2027 can do so. They will then sit for the common national examination, the Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) in 2027.  
  
**13\. Will there still be lateral transfers available under this new system?**

Schools will guide students on their subject and subject level options based on their individual circumstances, strengths and interests in different subjects, overall ability to cope and well-being.  
  
**14\. Under Full SBB, will students still take GCE O- and N-Level examinations at the end of their secondary education?**

The subject will require student to have a strong mastery of the language as they will be exposed to a range of texts - local texts, literary texts, news articles etc., which require a higher level of thinking and analytical skills. Students will be assessed on 3 components at the ‘O’ levels: Oral, Composition Writing and Comprehension.  
  
For MTL, the key aim is for students to develop skills for them to be able to continue learning and appreciating the language beyond their schooling years.
